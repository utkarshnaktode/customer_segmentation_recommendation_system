# customer_segmentation_recommendation_system
In this project, we aim to transform transactional data into a customer-centric dataset by creating new features that will facilitate the segmentation of customers into distinct groups using the K-means clustering algorithm. This segmentation will allow us to understand the unique profiles and preferences of various customer groups.
